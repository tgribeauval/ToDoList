# My TODO-List

The my TODO-LIST app allows users to have all of their to-do lists all in one place. Furthermore, the my TODO-LIST app is completly self categorizing. This means that the user simply has to type what they feel like watching or reading or buying, and this app will place it in the right category. Furthermore, it will provide additional information regarding the placed items (e.g. provide a restaurant name, movie review, product price).


# HOW IT WORKS
Lets take Harry Potter as an example. If you want to watch it, type in "watch Harry Potter". If you want to read Harry Potter, type "read Harry Potter". If you want to buy Harry Potter type  "buy Harry Potter". If you're hungry for pizza, type "eat pizza". If you simply type Harry Potter, it will be put into the "OTHER" list. The user may also update the category manually or delete an item, and the information will be updated automatically.
